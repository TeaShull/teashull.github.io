## Preamble

This tutorial will cover RNA seq analysis using Salmon using a publically available RNAseq dataset for testing the [transcriptomic response of *Arabidopsis thaliana* to dopamine](https://doi.org/10.3390/stresses3010026). There are many ways to extract count data from a transcriptomics dataset and the beginning of the tutorial is a fairly general approach to quality assessment, data cleaning and alignment. This tutorial will use open-source bioinformatics packages. To make following easier, I have included a conda environment. 

packages include: 

tximport  
Salmon  
Numpy  
Pandas  

{% highlight ruby %}
git clone 
{% endhighlight %}
